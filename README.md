🧠 CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras and TensorFlow to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck). The goal is to build, train, and evaluate a deep learning model that can achieve high accuracy in identifying objects in the dataset.

🚀 Features
-Loads and preprocesses CIFAR-10 dataset.
-Visualizes class distribution and sample images.
-Builds a multi-layer CNN with Batch Normalization and Dropout.
-Trains the model with accuracy/loss tracking and validation.
-Displays accuracy/loss graphs for training progress.
-Generates a confusion matrix and classification report.
-Visualizes correct and misclassified examples.
-Saves the trained model for future use.
